 Nagios Container Deployment Test V0.1
#################################################

04/01/2017 - AJM

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Before testing; check your Radius/Postfix/Rsyslog targets as they
will need to be altered to the currently none existent Dev infrastructure.

ABOUT
This is for testing purposes only, it gives a slight mirror to the
live OSS Nagios servers - At present it will only monitor the
local container unless otherwise instructed.

FUTURE
The networking & volume is to be added at a later date after tests have
been completed. These will probably be required if we are to deploy
a Docker service beyond the development stage.
